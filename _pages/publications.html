title: "Subtask-Level Elastic Scheduling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rtss2024/
date: 2024-12-01
venue: "45th Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS)"
citation: "Sudvarg, M., Wang, D., Buhler, J., and Gill, C. Subtask-Level Elastic Scheduling. Proceedings of the 45th Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS), 2024."
excerpt: "Introduces a new framework for subtask-level elasticity in real-time task scheduling."
category: conference
---
<!-- This paper presents a novel elastic scheduling framework at the subtask level to better support variable computational workloads in real-time systems. The method was evaluated using both synthetic workloads and embedded system benchmarks. The work was published in RTSS 2024. -->

title: "Elastic Scheduling for Harmonic Task Systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rtas2024/
date: 2024-04-01
venue: "30th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)"
citation: "Sudvarg, M., Li, A., Wang, D., Baruah, S., Buhler, J., Gill, C., Zhang, N., and Ekberg, P. Elastic Scheduling for Harmonic Task Systems. RTAS 2024."
excerpt: "Extends elastic scheduling theory to harmonic task systems and proposes analytical guarantees for schedulability."
category: conference
---
<!-- This work generalizes elastic task scheduling to harmonic task systems, which often appear in embedded and cyber-physical system workloads. It introduces techniques to maintain schedulability under varying execution demands. The paper is accepted for presentation at RTAS 2024. -->
